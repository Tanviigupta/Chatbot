# Chatbot

A basic chatbot made using Python and NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a simple conversational agent that can understand and respond to user input using predefined patterns and responses.
I have define very basic and limited pairs of patterns and responses for the chatbot and some related to mental health issues.
